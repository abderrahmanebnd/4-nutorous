# Natours Project

Natours is a comprehensive tour booking application built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It was developed as part of Jonas Schmedtmann's [Node.js course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/) on Udemy. The application serves as a backend project to demonstrate advanced Node.js concepts, RESTful APIs, authentication, and deployment techniques.
